## Notes

The concept of ML is depicted with an example of predicting the price of a car. The ML model
learns from data, represented as some **features** such as year, mileage, among others, and the **target** variable, in this
case, the car's price, by extracting patterns from the data.

Then, the model is given new data (**without** the target) about cars and predicts their price (target). 

In summary, ML is a process of **extracting patterns from data**, which is of two types:

* features (information about the object) and 
* target (property to predict for unseen objects). 

Therefore, new feature values are presented to the model, and it makes **predictions** from the learned patterns.
